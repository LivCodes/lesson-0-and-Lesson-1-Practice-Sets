## Describe the purpose of HTTP Status Codes. Why are these important?
> The purpose of HTTP status codes is to allow the developer to know what went wrong while attempting to receive or send data to the server. It is also neccessary that the developer codes accurate status codes into the apps written to let other developers know and make the user experience better by displaying messages that tell the user what happened.

## What is the difference between a URL and a URI?
> The difference between a URL and a URI is A URL is a global address of documents and protocols to retrieve resource on a computer network. URLs occur most frequently in reference to web pages (HTTP) but can also be used for database access using JDBC, email (mailto), file transfer (FTP), and many other applications. URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. While a URI is a string containing characters that identify a physical or logical resource. URI follows syntax rules to ensure uniformity. Moreover, it also maintains extensibility via a hierarchical naming scheme. The full form of URI is Uniform Resource Identifier. The main aim of URL is to get the location or address of a resource whereas the main aim of URI is to find a resource. URL is used to locate only web pages, on the other hand, URI in used in HTML, XML and other files. URL contains components such as protocol, domain, path, hash, query string, etc. while, URI contains components like scheme, authority, path, query, etc.

## What is the purpose of query params? How do we use them in our applications?
> The purpose of query params is they are optional key-value pairs that appear after the question mark in the URL. Basically, they are extensions of the URL that are utilized to help determine specific content or action based on the data being delivered. Query parameters are appended to the end of the URL, using a ‘?’. The question mark sign is used to separate path and query parameters. If you want to add multiple query parameters, an ‘&’ sign is placed in between them to form what is known as a query string. It can feature various object types with distinct lengths such as arrays, strings, and numbers. In Class we used these parameters as a way to grab data from the url and interpolate it in to the app by changing the name that was displayed.
